                <h3 class="red">What do we know about Mad?</h3><span class="yellow">Mad is a creature which is filled with purple and blue energy balls, it will get mad and crazy when the 
                    environment goes worse. Mad's well being can be easily influenced by the environment, and the environment would be influenced by
                    the mood of individual in reality.  The energy ball can help Mad to get energy when the environment was good. 
                <br>
                <h3 class="red">Human percieving Guideline :</h3><span class="yellow"> 
                    Try to do something in the "reality" by pressing "A, S, D, W, E" and percieve the mental world in different
                    reality moods. You can also click it in different mood to see what would happen. To be honest, Mad is pretty easygoing when the 
                    environment was nice. But energy would run away when sky gets dark, try to make them stay!
